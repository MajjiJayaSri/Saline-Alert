# Saline-Alert
This project is about saline automated alert system.

In this project we used Hardware components like Arduino Nano, Load Cell(10kg), ESP32 and buzzer.

When a saline is injected to patient monitoring saline content will increases the work of nurses. So we automated this process by adding a sensor to the saline bottle. Here the sensor used is LoadCell(10kg).

We measure the saline content by it's weight. If the weight read is less than the threshold then we will get the buzzer sound until the nurse off that buzzer.
This is how it works.

For this project we need to install Arduino IDE to code it.
